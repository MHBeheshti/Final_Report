\textbf{Abstract:}

This chapter provides a comprehensive literature survey on mutual coupling 
reduction in microstrip antenna arrays, a critical challenge in modern wireless 
communication. It begins by explaining that mutual coupling, caused by 
electromagnetic interaction between closely spaced antenna elements via space 
waves and surface waves, significantly degrades array performance by distorting 
radiation patterns and causing impedance mismatches. The primary focus is on 
Defected Ground Structures (DGS), which are etched patterns in the ground plane 
that create frequency stopbands to effectively suppress surface waves and improve 
isolation. The text details various DGS geometries, highlighting the compact T-shaped 
DGS as particularly effective for both E-plane and H-plane coupling reduction, and 
also touches upon Photonic Bandgap (PBG) structures and other advanced methods. 
Ultimately, the chapter demonstrates that mitigating mutual coupling, particularly 
with DGS, is crucial for preserving desired array performance, such as achieving low side lobe levels.
